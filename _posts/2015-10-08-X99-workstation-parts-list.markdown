Planning on making a new workstation soon.  This will be my reward for finishing a long term work project!  This system will dual boot Ubuntu and Windows.  This will be the first time I experiment with closed-loop liquid cooling so I'm excited about that.

I guess I'll have to go ahead and buy Win 10 Pro since I need windows for a few things and due to gaming and simplicity requirements I can't really just run Windows in a VM (although that would be handy).
