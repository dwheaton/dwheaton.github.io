Finally got to build my new workstation and gaming PC with all-in-one closed loop liquid coolers. The kids helped and learned a lot about computer parts! They were getting really into grounding themselves which was awesome.

Liquid Cooling
--------------

I'm not really into overclocking since I need my PC to be stable for work and it also isn't worth the time investment for me. I'm enjoying a very fast PC that is extremely quiet even under heavy load.

Here's what the cooling setup looks like: <img src="/images/20160312_173517.jpg">

Performance
-----------

With a 6 core CPU, 32 GB DDR4 RAM in a quad-channel configuration, and a very fast GPU this is a big upgrade for me from the old core i7 920. I also found some DDR4 RAM with a very low 10 CAS rating so I hope that will serve me well.

### Next Up... ###

Now I begin the long process of installing and configuring software, testing, minor benchmarking, and migrating development environments over as get this system ready to take the place of my current 6 year old system. With a little luck this system should last 5+ years as well.
