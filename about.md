###What's this all about?###

Hi, I'm David Wheaton, a self-employed computer programmer living in Ojai, CA.  I made this site a tech journal to keep track of projects and interests. Here's what I'm currently interested in and working on:

* Python and django web application development. This is my bread and butter.
* [CurbsideMe](https://www.curbsideme.com/) - Q&A site connecting doctors and industry researchers
* system administration (working with Ansible and Docker lately)
* Working on personal Unity3D [serious game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_game) projects and enjoying C# programming
* Expanding my horizons and learning about various software engineering paradigms:
  * rule-based programming ([RETE algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rete_algorithm), [Drools](http://www.drools.org/), etc.
  * simulation (specifically looking at the [adevs](http://web.ornl.gov/~1qn/adevs/) codebase)
  * cognitive architectures (specifically focusing on [Soar](http://soar.eecs.umich.edu/))
  * AI topics:
    * planning
    * symbolic programming
    * knowledge representaiton
    * ontologies
    * semantic web topics
    * and all that jazz
* Taking quite a few online classes
  * (current) [Coursera Cryptography I - Stanford University](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto/)
  * (completed 10/26/2015) [Coursera Machine Learning - Stanford University](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
  * (completed 09/03/2015) [Coursera Model Thinking - University of Michigan](https://www.coursera.org/learn/modelthinking)
  * (completed 08/10/2015) [edX cs190.1x - Scalable Machine Learning](https://www.edx.org/course/scalable-machine-learning-uc-berkeleyx-cs190-1x)
  * (completed 05/08/2015) [edX EE40LX - Electronic Interfaces: Bridging the Physical and Digital Worlds](https://www.edx.org/course/electronic-interfaces-bridging-physical-uc-berkeleyx-ee40lx-0)
  * (completed 05/05/2015) [edX Engineering Software as a Service (SaaS), Part 2 - BerkeleyX](https://www.edx.org/course/engineering-software-service-saas-part-2-uc-berkeleyx-cs169-2x)
  * (completed 12/26/2014) [edX Engineering Software as a Service (SaaS), Part 1 - BerkeleyX](https://www.edx.org/course/engineering-software-service-saas-part-1-uc-berkeleyx-cs169-1x)
  * a bunch of other [udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) courses
  * a bunch of other math classes to brush up on calculus and re-learn and extend my existing knowledge of advanced maths such as differential equations and applications like numerical methods.
* an electronics project to make a programmable LED jo staff
* Music and DJ stuff
* Indie game programming
* Aikido
* Learning some easy guitar songs to play for my kids
* Showcase some interesting past projects: minks, flatweb, etc
* Making audio mix CDs with Audacity

I hope to write more about these topics as time permits!
