Various things I'm working on, dubiously useful tidbits, etc. 

I'm currently involved in that I am planning on writing more about:

* django web application development (this is my bread and butter)
* system administration (working with Ansible and Docker lately)
* Working on personal Unity3D [serious game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_game) projects and enjoying C# programming
* Expanding my horizons and learning about various software engineering paradigms:
  * rule-based programming ([RETE algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rete_algorithm), [Drools](http://www.drools.org/), etc.
  * simulation (specifically looking at the [adevs](http://web.ornl.gov/~1qn/adevs/) codebase)
  * cognitive architectures (specifically focusing on [Soar](http://soar.eecs.umich.edu/))
  * AI topics:
    * planning
    * symbolic programming
    * knowledge representaiton
    * ontologies
    * semantic web topics
    * and all that jazz
* Taking quite a few online classes

  * a bunch of other [udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) courses
  * a bunch of other math classes to brush up on calculus and re-learn and extend my existing knowledge of advanced maths such as differential equations and applications like numerical methods.
* an electronics project to make an LED glow jo staff
